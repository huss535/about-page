<h3>Hey there, I'm a computer science explorer in year three at the University of Auckland — your friendly neighborhood code-slinger! 🚀</h3>
<h3>When I'm not cracking code, you'll find me immersed in books, jotting down words, or painting my thoughts onto canvas. 📚🎨</h3>
<h3>From coding symphonies to jamming to my favorite tunes and turning movie nights into mini-adventures — I'm the ultimate tech geek and entertainment aficionado! 🎵🎬</h3>
<h3>Oh, and did I mention? I'm a proud member of the Star Wars alliance and a comic book connoisseur. May the force be with you! 🌌📚</h3>
