# Personal Page

- I created this to act as an introduction to me.
- I am hosting on Pages, well, because it is free.
- I tested the page on an EC2 instance via an Apache server before that.

## About me

- This section contains more personal information about myself.

## Skills
- Contains an overview of my skills and things I am currently doing.

## Good Reads and Movies

- Has some movie and books recommendation.
- For this section, I opted to import **Splide**, a lightweight carousel, to display images of the movies and books.

## Music
- I added code showing a playlist I made on apple music, which I will update regularly.

## Cursor Image Function

- I have a single Python file called handle.py in the images folder.
- The primary use was to resize a specific image to be used as a cursor.

## Star Wars character name feature

   - I had an awesome feature in the About Me section, a button that gives you the name of a random Star Wars character by invoking an aws
  lambda function.

  - Sadly, after working, it started misbehaving due to problems with CORS, so I am currently working on a fix.
